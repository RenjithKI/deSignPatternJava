 * Note
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, it is a lightweight data-interchange format. 
You can see many Java applications started to throw away XML format and start using JSON
 as a new data-interchange format. Java is all about object, often times,
 you need to convert an object into JSON format for data-interchange or vice verse.
